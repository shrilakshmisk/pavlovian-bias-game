        <h2>Game Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Youâ€™re about to embark on a mission where youâ€™ll interact with mysterious alien ships appearing in Earthâ€™s orbit. There are 4 types of alien ships. They differ in how they look. 
          Each ship will be either <b style={{ color: "red" }}>red</b> or <b style={{ color: "green" }}>green</b>, and your task is to decide whether to knock on it or not. Pay attention to other features too.
        </p>
        <p><b>Press the space bar</b> to knock. Doing nothing means you choose not to knock.</p>
        <p>
          Each alien ship will be displayed for <b>5 seconds</b>. During this time, you must decide whether to knock or not.
          <b>You must press the space bar before the 5 seconds are over</b>. If you choose not to knock, simply wait and do nothing until the timer runs out.
          A countdown timer will be visible at the <b>top-left corner</b> of the screen to help you keep track.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aliens donâ€™t always reward the same actions! Knocking may earn you points, but sometimes, staying back might be the smarter move.
          Your goal is to collect as many rewards as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter your <b>roll number</b> as your username.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please <b>open the game link only once</b>. Reloading or opening it multiple times may disrupt your progress and data.
        </p>
        <p><b>Press the space bar or click "Got it!" to continue ðŸš€</b></p>
