        <h2>Game Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Youâ€™re about to embark on a mission where youâ€™ll interact with mysterious alien ships appearing in Earthâ€™s orbit. There are 4 types of alien ships. They differ in how they look. 
          Each ship will be either <b style={{ color: "red" }}>red</b> or <b style={{ color: "green" }}>green</b>, and your task is to decide whether to knock on it or not. Pay attention to other features too.
        </p>
        <p><b>Press the space bar</b> to knock. Doing nothing means you choose not to knock.</p>
        <p>
          The aliens donâ€™t always reward the same actions! Knocking may earn you points, but sometimes, staying back might be the smarter move.
          Your goal is to collect as many rewards as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, you will first complete a short <b>practice trial</b> to get familiar with how the game works.  
          For the practice, please enter your roll number as your username and continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the final experiment, make sure to enter your <b>roll number</b> as your username.
        </p>
        <p>The entire game spans approximately <b>30 minutes</b>, so make sure youâ€™re comfortable and free from distractions before starting.</p>
        <p><b>Press the space bar or click "Got it!" to continue ðŸš€</b></p>
